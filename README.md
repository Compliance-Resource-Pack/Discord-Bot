### Bot config:

**DISCLAIMER: We won't help you rebranding the bot for any other server. If you really want to do that, then you need to figure it out yourself.**

- Create an app on the **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)**.
- Go to the **Bot** tab, create a bot and copy its token.
- Create a file named **.env** or rename the **.env.example** file to **.env**.
- Open the **.env** file using any text editor.
- This file contains general bot settings in this format:

|Field name|Example value|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|CLIENT_TOKEN|"-"|The token you copied from the Developer Portal, used to login the bot.|
|PREFIX|"/"|This is the character used to execute commands.|
|UIDR & UIDJ|"123456789123456789"|The user id's of both bot maintainers.|
|MAINTENANCE|"false"|Makes all commands maintainer-only, sets status to dnd.|
|MODS|"987654321987654321"|The id's of all people with a moderator role or higher, used for the modping command.|

There also is `messages.js` and `settings.js` with various other settings, but that aren't needed for the bot to run.
